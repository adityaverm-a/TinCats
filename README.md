#TinCats


This is a landing page for a made company called TinCats (a Tinder Clone for cats). As by the name of it you can figure that I love Cats.
This is my version of the website, that I was taught by Dr. Angela Yu from her [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)


I had a lot of fun making this landing page.

Here's the live deployed version of it:[Live Preview](https://adityaverm-a.github.io/TinCats/)
